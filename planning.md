# Planning

## To Dont's

- Create a jupyter notebook in google colaboratory for easier sharing with others.
  - Not much clear benefit for me right now as I have it working locally
- Convert to a JavaScript web application, no more python.
  - Lots of work with not a lot of clear benefit besides having a gui again.
  - Monetization from it is questionably going to work.
